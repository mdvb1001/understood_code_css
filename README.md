css code challenge

# Notes:
* Initially, I built this grid with "regular" `div`s and percentages in the CSS `width` properties. As I refreshed my memory on some of these basic CSS concepts, I stumbled upon the CSS Grid Container (`grid-gap` and `grid-template-columns`). This tool seemed tailor-made for this mini-project, so I used it instead.
* I took the liberty to add some minimal styling: background colors and numbered cells. I did this to highlight what I thought were the essential requirements of the assignment.
